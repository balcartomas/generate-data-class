<h1>**Generate Data Class from database Table**</h1>
<br>
<p>The Groovy script created for easy Data Class generation, similar to creating POJO classes, is usable in IntelliJ IDEA. It's a straightforward approach to create classes and imports, primarily designed for my own use, and you may need to make some adjustments.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“– INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a "Generate Data class.groovy" file in the following path: Scratches and Consoles -> Extensions -> Database Tools and SQL -> schema</li>

<li>In the Database panel, select a table and right-click on it.</li>
<li>Choose "Tools -> Scripted Extensions -> Generate Data class."</li>

<li>Select the location for the generated Data Class.</li>
</ol>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>I'm not a Groovy developer, and this was my first "larger" encounter with this language. I simply wanted to simplify the process of creating Data Classes from database tables.</p>
<p>The script was created with the help of the original script in IntelliJ IDEA and modified specifically for generating Kotlin Data Classes.</p>
